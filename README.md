# DownBad
The DownBad Smart Contract is meant to serve as a prototype for how simple smart contracts can be used to automate institutions such as charities. This prototype allows people to add and remove themselves from a list. When people donate money to the smart contract, the donation is automatically dispersed evenly amongst those on the list.

## Getting Started

- Install Metamask
- Get ether from Ropsten Test Network
- Access interface from the following page: TODO
- Enjoy messing around with this prototype

## Future work
The prototype is meant to show that it is possible to run a charity with minimal human interaction. However, charities are more complex than just putting money into an account and then sending it to those in need. The funds of a charity can be managed in a unique number of ways that best fits the problem to be solved. One potential next step for this project would be to develop this into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO so that those most passionate about a charitable effort can have a say about how funds are dispersed.
