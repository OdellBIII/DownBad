# DownBad
The DownBad Smart Contract is meant to serve as a prototype for how simple smart contracts can be used to automate institutions such as charities. This prototype allows people to add and remove themselves from a list. When people donate money to the smart contract, the donation is automatically dispersed evenly amongst those on the list.
