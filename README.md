# Charity-Dapp
The Charity-Dapp Smart Contract is meant to serve as a prototype for how simple smart contracts can be used to automate institutions such as charities. This prototype allows people to add and remove themselves from a list. When people donate money to the smart contract, the donation is automatically dispersed evenly amongst those on the list.

## Getting Started

### Install Metamask
Access the following link to download and install the Metamask extension for your browser: https://metamask.io/download. Once it is installed, switch the network to Ropsten Test Network. It should look something like this at the top ![Screen Shot 2021-12-14 at 10 00 14 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30204757/146023232-b7dfdc48-cb5e-497b-a659-b889a848fa74.png)

### Get ether from Ropsten Test Network
Once you have Metamask setup and set to the Ropsten Test Network, use the following faucet to add ether to your account: https://faucet.metamask.io/

## Future work
The prototype is meant to 
show that it is possible to run a charity with minimal human interaction. However, charities are more complex than just putting money into an account and then sending it to those in need. The funds of a charity can be managed in a unique number of ways that best fits the problem to be solved. One potential next step for this project would be to develop this into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO so that those most passionate about a charitable effort can have a say about how funds are dispersed.
